# Library Management CLI - Python

## Overview:
This Python CLI (Command-Line Interface) application is designed for library management, providing functionalities for organizing sections and books with automatic data saving. It allows users to create, select, and manage multiple libraries, each containing a collection of books.

## Features:
1. **Library Section Creation:** Users can create a new library by specifying a name for it.
2. **Library Section Selection:** Users can select an existing library to manage or create a new one.
3. **Book Management:**
   - Add new books to the library with quantities.
   - Modify existing books: change name, quantity, add/subtract quantity, or remove a book.
4. **Data Persistence:** Library data is automatically saved to JSON files, ensuring data persistence across sessions.

## Installation:
1. Clone the repository or download the Python script.
2. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
3. Install the required packages using pip:

## Usage:
1. Run the Python script (`Library Management.py`).
2. Follow the on-screen prompts to create a new library or select an existing one.
3. Use the CLI menu to add, modify, or remove books from the selected library.
4. Library data will be automatically saved to JSON files in the project directory.

## Note:
- This CLI application is suitable for small-scale library management tasks and provides a simple yet effective interface for organizing books.
- For larger-scale library management or more advanced features, consider using dedicated library management software or databases.
